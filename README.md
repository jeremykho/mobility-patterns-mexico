#### Executive Summary

To gain a deeper understanding of the lifestyles and mobility of the inhabitants of Mexico City, urban science methods, such as percolation theory, fractals, and the extended radiation model, were applied using both Python and MATLAB.

Moreover, conventional data from Origin-Destination surveys were supplemented by points of interest scraped from the Google Places API with the help of the Uber H3 API, serving as proxy for trip attraction.

#### Abstract

Throughout the world, people struggle with safety, economic opportunity, and health. Seamless access to destinations they value, such as workplaces, schools, hospitals, and parks, influences their quality of life. One of the first steps to planning and improving accessibility is to estimate the number of trips being made across different parts of a city. However, the spatial distribution and availability of urban services, may come short in supplying the needs of their inhabitants. Relying on expensive and infrequently collected travel surveys for modeling trip distributions to their facilities slow down the decision making process. The growing abundance of data already collected, if analyzed with the right methods, can help us in planning and understanding cities. In this chapter, we examine the use of points of interests (POIs) registered on Google Places to approximate trip attraction in a city. First, we compare the result of trip distribution models that utilize only POIs with those utilizing conventional data sets, based on surveys. We show that an extended radiation provides a high degree of accuracy when compared with the official Origin-Destination Matrices from the latest census in Mexico City. Moreover, we apply percolation theory to the POIs to produce meaningful insights into the functional dynamics of the city. In particular, we estimate the available number of facilities per capita, taking into account the different income groups. We illustrate novel applications of urban science, adapted to data readily available worldwide in the form of geo-mapped points of interest and population density.
